Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It. The software they wanted designed needed to allow the game applicaition to have a game with one or more teams involved, each team having multiple players, unique naming, and be on multiple platforms.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I did well writing the executive summary, design constraints, and domain mode.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- The design document helped guide some of my thinking process and wirte code. It made it easier to have a template to look back on when writing.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise my reccomendations. I would add more details about storage and memory management, discuss client/server in operating systems architecture, and discuss REST, HTTP, and JSON in distributed systems and networks.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The user's needs were apart of the entire design process. I incorporated the user's needs by making the storage and memory requirement low, and using the most used OS. The user's needs is important because without the users, the game is useless.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I used an Agile approach. I would use the same in the future.
